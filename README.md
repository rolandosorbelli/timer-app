# React Timer Web App

This web app has been created using `create-react-app` command of React library. It consists in a single web page with a timer that starts when you visit the page. The layout is pretty simple, there is just a text with an oval in the middle - created with pure CSS.

The logic behind that works using the inbuilt React function `componentDidMount(){}` that belongs to the Component Lifecycle and starts when an instance of component has been called (in our case the Timer component).

Every single element of the page has been divided into single React components and declared into separate files, called in the main App.js file.

How to start

After you forked this repo run npm start on your terminal and the app will be executed in your http://localhost:3000 on your browser.
